# fiji-friends
Fiji macro scripts and other helpers, as needed. Primarily designed for use in common workflows and in converting large imaging files to quick reference jpgs and pngs.

Current use suggestion:
1. Clone repo.
2. Open script of interest, read commentary and caveats.
3. Use whatever functions are helpful and adjust.
4. Global adjustments (e.g. you simplified something, added a func, etc) push back to main branch.
